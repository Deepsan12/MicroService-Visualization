Our architecture visualization proof-of-concept aims to provide an interactive visualization framework for cloud native systems. Currently, the web-based application takes a JSON file describing the microservice-based system in the abstract terms of nodes and links and generates a high-level 2D and 3D perspective of the system. The resulting perspectives are highly customizable and interactive to allow for control over the holistic system view.
